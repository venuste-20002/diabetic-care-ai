Step 1: Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and navigate to the ai_engine directory:
cd C:\Users\educa\Desktop\vivance capstone\glucogard\ai_engine

Step 2: Create a virtual environment named 'venv':
python -m venv venv

Step 3: Activate the virtual environment:
- For Command Prompt:
  venv\Scripts\activate.bat
- For PowerShell:
  venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Step 4: Install the required packages from requirements.txt:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 5: Run your FastAPI app inside the activated virtual environment:
uvicorn main:app --reload

This will ensure that all dependencies including 'joblib' are installed and available to your app.
